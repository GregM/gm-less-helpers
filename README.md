# GM-LESS-HELPERS

>These are less helpers that I've found useful over the years. It should be self-explanatory but if you have any issues, please contact me at <gregory.mazurek@gmail.com>. 

>I'll update this as frequently as I can but in the interim, please feel free to submit further less helpers.

>Just in case you need more info, you can learn more about Less [here](http://lesscss.org/).
